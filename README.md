## Project

This was part of the udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

## What I learned

- `useContext()` and `useReducer()` hooks to handle complex state
- how to build custom hooks. I built a custom input hook to handle state and validation for form inputs
- `async/await` and `fetch()` api. I made both GET and POST requests to a Firbase api to fetch the backend meals list and add the user cart purchases to the server
- handled error states with `try/catch` syntax
- handled loading states
